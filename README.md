# Advent of Code 2023 in Rust

Doing Advent of Code 2023 in Rust - just for joy and:

- persisting and expanding my general Rust knowledge
- learning FP concepts through/in Rust
- getting to know Rust's stdlib better


Each exercise has its own cargo project subdirectory with the sample input in `sample.txt` and my personalized `input.txt` as well as the solution to both parts in `src/main.rs`.

The top level (where you find this `README.md`) contains a template file `template.rs` that I started from each day.
